We should start an immediate investigation into @SenSchumer and his ties to Russia and Putin. A total hypocrite!
I don't know Putin have no deals in Russia and the haters are going crazy - yet Obama can make a deal with Iran #1 in terror no problem!
They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story found zero proof so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice
Uranium deal to Russia with Clinton help and Obama Administration knowledge is the biggest story that Fake Media doesn't want to follow!
I hereby demand a second investigation after Schumer of Pelosi for her close ties to Russia and lying about it.
When will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing not a bad thing. There always playing politics - bad for our country. I want to solve North Korea Syria Ukraine terrorism and Russia can greatly help!
Just out: The same Russian Ambassador that met Jeff Sessions visited the Obama White House 22 times and 4 times last year alone.
"Who was it that secretly said to Russian President ""Tell Vladimir that after the election I'll have more flexibility?"" @foxandfriends"
Why is that Hillary Clintons family and Dems dealings with Russia are not looked at but my non-dealings are?
Since the first day I took office all you hear is the phony Democrat excuse for losing the election Russia RussiaRussia.  Despite this I have the economy booming and have possibly done more than any 10 month President. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"Wow CNN had to retract big story on ""Russia"" with 3 employees forced to resign. What about all the other phony stories they do? FAKE NEWS!"
Fake News CNN is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony Russian stories. Ratings way down!
Just out: The Obama Administration knew far in advance of November 8th about election meddling by Russia. Did nothing about it. WHY?
Our relationship with Russia is at an all-time & very dangerous  low. You can thank Congress the same people that can't even give us HCare!
Does the Fake News Media remember when Crooked Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State was begging Russia to be our friend with the misspelled reset button? Obama tried also but he had zero chemistry with Putin.
"After 1 year of investigation with Zero evidence being found Chuck Schumer just stated that ""Democrats should blame ourselvesnot Russia."""
It is now commonly agreed after many months of COSTLY looking that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump. Was collusion with HC!
This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign.
The Democrats had to come up with a story as to why they lost the election and so badly (306) so they made up a story - RUSSIA. Fake news!
The Russia hoax continues now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?
"Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is ""sick."" All G 20 leaders and spouses were invited by the Chancellor of Germany. Press knew!"
By the way if Russia was working so hard on the 2016 Election it all took place during the Obama Admin. Why didn't they stop them?
Why isn't the House Intelligence Committee looking into the Bill & Hillary deal that allowed big Uranium to go to Russia Russian speech....
Workers of firm involved with the discredited and Fake Dossier take the 5th. Who paid for it Russia the FBI or the Dems (or all)?
The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 to sanction North Korea. China and Russia voted with us. Very big financial impact!
Why doesn't Fake News talk about Podesta ties to Russia as covered by @FoxNews or money from Russia to Clinton - sale of  Uranium?
"After 7 months of investigations & committee hearings about my ""collusion with the Russians""  nobody has been able to show any proof. Sad!"
Russia must be laughing up their sleeves watching as the U.S. tears itself apart over a Democrat EXCUSE for losing the election.
Crimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration. Was Obama too soft on Russia?
The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win..
So why aren't the Committees and investigators and of course our beleaguered A.G. looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?
...What about all of the Clinton ties to Russia including Podesta Company Uranium deal Russian Reset big dollar speeches etc.
Russia talk is FAKE NEWS put out by the Dems and played up by the media in order to mask the big election defeat and the illegal leaks!
The first meeting Jeff Sessions had with the Russian Amb was set up by the Obama Administration under education program for 100 Ambs......
...the Uranium to Russia deal the  33000 plus deleted Emails the Comey fix and so much more. Instead they look at phony Trump/Russia....
Things will work out fine between the U.S.A. and Russia. At the right time everyone will come to their senses & there will be lasting peace!
"All of this ""Russia"" talk right when the Republicans are making their big push for historic Tax Cuts & Reform. Is this coincidental? NOT!"
".@foxandfriends ""Russia sent millions to Clinton Foundation"""
"Obama Administration official said they ""choked"" when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election. They didn't want to hurt Hillary?"
...We negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives. Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!
Jared Kushner did very well yesterday in proving he did not collude with the Russians. Witch Hunt. Next up 11 year old Barron Trump!
"It is the same Fake News Media that said there is ""no path to victory for Trump"" that is now pushing the phony Russia story. A total scam!"
Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.
When will Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd and @NBCNews start talking about the Obama SURVEILLANCE SCANDAL and stop with the Fake Trump/Russia story?
What about all of the contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians? Also is it true that the DNC would not let the FBI in to look?
Since the Obama Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians were meddling why no action? Focus on them not T!
"Sleazy Adam Schiff the totally biased Congressman looking into ""Russia"" spends all of his time on television pushing the Dem loss excuse!"
Just watched the totally biased and fake news reports of the so-called Russia story on NBC and ABC. Such dishonesty!
Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia
Interesting to watch Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut talking about hoax Russian collusion when he was a  phony Vietnam con artist!
Was the brother of John Podesta paid big money to get the sanctions on Russia lifted? Did Hillary know?
The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign. Big advantage in Electoral College & lost!
As the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold Democrats and Russians!
Putin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit    so that election hacking & many other negative things will be guarded..
Thank you to former campaign adviser Michael Caputo for saying so powerfully that there was no Russian collusion in our winning campaign.
The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit  doesn't mean I think it can happen. It can't-but a ceasefire can& did!
Sanctions were not discussed at my meeting with President Putin. Nothing will be done until the Ukrainian & Syrian problems are solved!
As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H. meeting) which I have the absolute right to do facts pertaining....
Again the story that there was collusion between the Russians & Trump campaign was fabricated by Dems as an excuse for losing the election.
I look forward to all meetings today with world leaders including my meeting with Vladimir Putin. Much to discuss.#G20Summit #USA????
The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling. With 4 months looking at Russia...
"...money to Bill the Hillary Russian ""reset"" praise of Russia by Hillary or Podesta Russian Company. Trump Russia story is a hoax. #MAGA!"
Former Homeland Security Advisor Jeh Johnson is latest top intelligence official to state there was no grand scheme between Trump & Russia.
In other words Russia was against Trump in the 2016 Election - and why not I want strong military & low oil prices. Witch Hunt!
I strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. He vehemently denied it. I've already given my opinion.....
...Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign?
Stock Market hit another all-time high yesterday - despite the Russian hoax story! Also jobs numbers are starting to look very good!
When will the Fake Media ask about the Dems dealings with Russia & why the DNC wouldn't allow the FBI to check their server or investigate?
...to terrorism and airline flight safety. Humanitarian reasons plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism.
"Director Clapper reiterated what everybody including the fake media already knows- there is ""no evidence"" of collusion w/ Russia and Trump."
"For eight years Russia ""ran over"" President Obama got stronger and stronger picked-off Crimea and added missiles. Weak! @foxandfriends"
James Clapper and others stated that there is no evidence Potus colluded with Russia. This story is FAKE NEWS and everyone knows it!
The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax when will this taxpayer funded charade end?
The Chinese Envoy who just returned from North Korea seems to have had no impact on Little Rocket Man. Hard to believe his people and the military put up with living in such horrible conditions. Russia and China condemned the launch.
"..not associated with Russia. Trump team spied on before he was nominated."" If this is true does not get much bigger. Would be sad for U.S."
Met with President Putin of Russia who was at #APEC meetings. Good discussions on Syria. Hope for his help to solve along with China the dangerous North Korea crisis. Progress being made.
So now it is reported that the Democrats who have excoriated Carter Page about Russia don't want him to testify. He blows away their....
